# Empire Online Website Title Parser

This project involves a script that parses the titles of movies from the Empire Online website and saves them in a text file named `movie.txt`. The script is designed to automate the process of extracting movie titles from the website and organizing them in a convenient format.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- Beautiful Soup 4 library
- Requests library

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python parsing.py
```

4. The script will scrape the Empire Online website for movie titles and save them in a file named `movie.txt` in the same directory.

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following:

- `URL`: The URL of the Empire Online webpage containing the movie titles. You can change it if the structure of the website changes or if you want to parse titles from a different page.

- `FILE_NAME`: The name of the output text file. You can change it if you want the output file to have a different name.

## Important Notes

- Web scraping can be subject to changes in website structure. If the website structure changes significantly, the script might need to be updated accordingly.

- Always be respectful of the website's terms of use and usage policies. Excessive or unauthorized scraping can lead to IP bans or legal issues.
